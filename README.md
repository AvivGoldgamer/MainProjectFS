At the base of the Project there is the Database:SQLServer

there are 3 classes that are connected to him, Admin, Company and Customer Repositories -- they have all the commands that speak directly 
to the Database like C.U.R.D(Create, Update, Read, Delete).

then there are 3 classes that are DBDAO (connection between the facades and the repositories), Admin, Company and Customer DBDAO -- 
thay have methods that use the repository's methods to talk to the Database using Spring Framework.

then there are 3 classes that are the Facades(the side that is closest to the client) -- their methods are most of the functionality and methodology all the validations the checks the flagging happends in the facades, it is the heart of the server.

then there are 3 classes that are Controllers(the connector between the requests from the client-side and the responses of the server-side using REST) -- they have methods that are being used by the client-side.
