there are 3 classes that are connected to him, Admin, Company and Customer Repositories -- they have all the commands that speak directly 
to the Database like C.U.R.D(Create, Update, Read, Delete).

then there are 3 classes that are DBDAO (connection between the facades and the repositories), Admin, Company and Customer DBDAO -- 
(insert info about the DBDAO).

controllers throught requests from the client-side(website) and they call the functions in the DBDAO.
